# K-Means and DBSCAN Clustering

## Overview
This project implements K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms on a dataset. The process includes data loading, preprocessing, determining the optimal number of clusters, applying clustering techniques, handling outliers, and comparing the results of both algorithms.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Load and Preprocess the Dataset
- Load the dataset using Python.
- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Normalize numerical features to ensure proper clustering.

### 2. Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters (K)
- Implement the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal value of K.
- Use the **Silhouette Score** to validate the number of clusters.

### 3. Apply K-Means Clustering
- Perform K-Means clustering on the dataset after preprocessing.
- Visualize the clustering results using a scatter plot.

### 4. Cluster Interpretation
- Assign cluster labels to the dataset and analyze cluster characteristics.
- Compute the average values of each feature for different clusters and interpret the results.

### 5. Handling Outliers
- Detect and remove outliers before clustering.
- Compare clustering results before and after outlier removal.

### 6. Comparison with Other Clustering Algorithms
- Implement **DBSCAN Clustering** and compare results with K-Means.
- Discuss scenarios where K-Means is preferable and where DBSCAN performs better.

## Installation and Dependencies
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code
1. Ensure the dataset is available in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```sh
   python clustering_analysis.py
   ```
3. The script will generate visualizations and cluster analysis results.

## Results & Discussion
- The **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** help determine the optimal K for K-Means.
- **K-Means Clustering** groups data points into clusters based on similarity.
- **DBSCAN Clustering** effectively handles noise and outliers, making it useful for datasets with varying density.
- **Outlier handling** improves clustering performance and data quality.
- **Comparison:** K-Means is efficient for well-separated spherical clusters, while DBSCAN is better for arbitrary-shaped clusters and noisy data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of K-Means and DBSCAN for clustering. The choice between these methods depends on data characteristics and application requirements.
